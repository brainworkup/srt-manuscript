= Introduction

This is my introductory paragraph.
The title will be placed above it automatically.
*Do not start with an introductory heading* (e.g., "Introduction").
The title acts as your Level 1 heading for the introduction.

Details about writing headings with markdown in APA style are https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/writing.html#headings-in-apa-style[here].

== Displaying Figures

A reference label for a figure must have the prefix `fig-`, and in a code chunk, the caption must be set with `fig-cap`.
Captions are in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case).

New mode |Syntax |Example
---------
- Code Prefix the code with \# Number: #(1 + 2)
- Math Surround equation with $..$ $-x$ is the opposite of $x$
- Markup Surround markup with [..] let name = [*Typst!*]
